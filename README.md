> A curated collection of publicly available resources on how companies around the world practice DevOps

## Introduction

__How They DevOps__ is a curated knowledge repository on DevOps related topics - CI/CD

There are many ways to practice DevOps. Fortunately, many companies are willing to share how they do it. I believe there is much to learn from this documented use cases and published resources. The content you'll find in this repository is a list of such resources.

The reosurces are indexed by companies, technologies, years and DevOps related topics

Happy Learning!

*Please note, that all the resources mentioned here are publicly available resources.*
